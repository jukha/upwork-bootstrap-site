                The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (also
                known as the CARES Act) was signed into law on March 27, 2020.
                It included two programs to assist businesses with keeping
                workers employed: the Payroll Protection Program (PPP)
                administered by the Small Business Adminstration and Employee
                Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) administered by the Internal Revenue
                Service. PPP funds are distributed based on 2.5 months of
                payroll and a minimum of 80% of the funds must be used on
                payroll to be eligible for forgiveness. Additionally, PPP funds
                are not taxable as revenue and you may still take deductions for
                the payroll covered by PPP. ERTC tax credits, however, are
                credits (or refunds) for a percentage of payroll in each quarter
                that you qualify. There are specific rules for determining
                eligibility by quarter, and limiting the dollars that can be
                claimed for each employee.

                Initially with the CARES Act, employers could choose to apply
                for PPP or claim ERTC credits, but not both. PPP was more
                beneficial than ERTC for most businesses (for reasons we won’t
                go into here) and so most businesses with under 500 employees
                received forgivable PPP Loans. On March 11, 2021, The American
                Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law and included many
                modifications and expansions to existing elements of previous
                stimulus programs. Noteworthy modifications for business owners
                included: Businesses who applied for and received PPP funds
                could now also claim ERTC credits. ERTC credits could be
                retroactively claimed for businesses that qualified in 2020.
                ERTC credits were extended through 9/30/21 with lower
                qualification requirements. The per-employee cap on qualifying
                wages increased from $10,000 for all of 2020 to $10,000 per
                quarter for the first 3 quarters of 2021. The refundable credit
                amount increased from 50% of qualifying wages in 2020 to 70% in
                2021. So the short answer is “Yes” . . . you can claim ERTC even
                if you received PPP funds.

                Unlike the Payroll Protection Program (administered by the Small
                Business Administration), there is actually no “application
                process” for the Employee Retention Tax Credits. You simply
                claim the ERTC tax credit like you would any other tax credit –
                by asserting to the IRS that you can legally claim the credit.
                When you claim a child tax credit, you do so by asserting this
                fact on your Form 1020 Personal Income Tax Return. The
                difference is that when you claim an ERTC tax credit, you do so
                on your Form 941 Employer Quarterly Tax Filing. For prior
                quarters, you must file an amended form (the Form 941-X) to
                reduce your current quarter’s tax contribution and request a
                refund of excess credits (which is highly likely). Another perk
                of ERTC, is that since you can often estimate these credits in
                advance of distributing cash for payroll, you can file a Form
                7200 to receive a cash advance to avoid waiting until the end of
                the quarter to apply for the refund.

                Even though you may feel like revenue is back to normal, there
                are some items you want to consider before passing on this ERTC
                assessment. First, even if revenues have returned to “normal” in
                2021, you may have qualified in 2020 and you can retroactively
                claim those credits. That eligibility criteria in 2020 was based
                on revenue declines from 2019, or if your business was partially
                or fully closed due to governmental mandate. Second, while your
                revenue may have returned to “normal” in Q1 2021, remember that
                we are comparing your Q1 2021 to Q1 2019. If 2019 was a year of
                growth for your business, then your revenue levels 2 years ago
                may have been much less than Q1 2020. And lastly, if your
                revenues were down in Q4 2020 by just 20% compared to Q4 2019,
                then you may also be eligible for Q1 2021. There is a safe
                harbor provision that few advisors are talking about, and it
                means that many businesses are qualifying for $7,000 per
                employee in Q1 2021. I know, it seems too good to be true, but
                the government wants to incentivize and reward you for keeping
                US residents employed and money flowing through our economy as
                we rebuild bigger and stronger than before.

                You are most likely referring to a provision of the CARES Act
                that allowed employers to defer the deposit and payment of the
                employer’s share of Social Security taxes. Those deferrals must
                then be repaid – with at least 50% of the balance due by
                12/31/21 and the remaining balance due by 12/31/22. ERTC credits
                are NOT a deferral. They are dollar-for-dollar credits against
                wages you’ve paid. Not taxes you’ve paid, but actual wages.
                These credits can offset future tax contributions or you can
                receive a refund check – it’s your choice. And you will NOT have
                to re-pay these funds (unless, of course, you don’t provide
                adequate documentation in the course of an audit).

                Your banker, CPA, or Financial Advisor was probably very helpful
                when it came to getting your PPP funds because they were
                effectively signing you to an SBA-guaranteed loan. The SBA paid
                the bank administrative fees based on the PPP loans they made,
                and so they were incentivized to educate you about the program
                and get all your paperwork in order. Compared to the ERTC, the
                PPP program was also a rather simple calculation. 2 ½ times your
                average monthly payroll including health insurance and state
                unemployment taxes. From the conversations we’ve had with
                bankers, they have no interest in involving themselves in your
                employment tax compliance. For them it is a liability and beyond
                their scope of services.

                credits requires visibility into your P&L and PPP forgiveness
                applications. Not only that, but the complex requirements around
                eligibility and allocating ERTC credits at the employee-level
                while accounting for annual and quarterly qualifying wage gaps
                and . . . well, you can probably tell why Payroll Services are
                not offering to do all of this for you. The Payroll Services
                that we’ve worked with so far are happy to provide the payroll
                registers that we need to perform the allocations. And they are
                happy to file the Amended Form 941-X with the IRS on our
                client’s behalf. But that’s the extent of it. In fact, most wise
                Payroll Services are asking clients to sign an indemnification
                waiver before submitting a Form 941-X because the Payroll
                Service can take no responsibility for the accuracy of the ERTC
                credits you are claiming. For them to involve themselves in the
                intricacies of this calculation, it is a liability and beyond
                their scope of services.

                Whether your tax accountant is a CPA or EA, he or she most
                likely only prepares your Federal and State Income Tax Returns.
                However, ERTC credits are claimed against Employment Taxes on
                Form 941, and cash advanced through Form 7200. The complexity of
                the ERTC program is a beast unto itself and every tax accountant
                we’ve talked to has said they focus on staying up-to-date on the
                ever-evolving income tax code, and they can’t now become experts
                in the ERTC program as well. If your tax accountant is
                comfortable determining your eligibility by quarter and year,
                computing your credits, and preparing contemporaneous
                documentation to support an IRS audit, then you should certainly
                let them handle all of this. If you want a second set of eyes on
                this, we’re happy to take a look.

                Your Bookkeeper should certainly have access to all the
                information that is needed for an accurate calculation of your
                legal ERTC claim. They will have your financial reports, payroll
                registers, and PPP loan forgiveness documents. The Million
                Dollar Question is . . . Do They Have The Time? Do they have the
                time to dig into the text of American Rescue Plan Act of 2021
                And its accompanying referenced laws like: CARES Act, Families
                First Act, Payroll & Healthcare Enhancement Act, PPP Payroll
                Flexibility Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Time to
                read the IRS Interpretations and FAQ’s? And cross-reference
                those definitions with that of PPP which was separately defined
                and dissimilarly interpreted in the Small Business
                Administration’s Bulletins and IFRs? Do they have the time to
                ensure accuracy in eligibility determination, maximize your
                computation and create the supporting documentation you’ll need
                to support an IRS audit of employer taxes? So far, we have not
                found a bookkeeper who is able to take all this on, while
                handling the day-to-day of bookkeeping. If yours can, then take
                them up on their offer. We’re happy to take a second look.
